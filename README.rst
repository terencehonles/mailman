Copyright (C) 1998-2011 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

This is GNU Mailman, a mailing list management system distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or later.  The name of
this software is spelled "Mailman" with a leading capital 'M' but with a lower
case second 'm'.  Any other spelling is incorrect.

Mailman is written in Python which is available for all platforms that Mailman
is supported on, including GNU/Linux and most other Unix-like operating
systems (e.g. Solaris, \*BSD, MacOSX, etc.).  Mailman is not supported on
Windows, although web and mail clients on any platform should be able to
interact with Mailman just fine.

The Mailman home page is:

    http://www.list.org

and there is a community driven wiki at
