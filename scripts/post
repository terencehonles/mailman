"""Accept posts to a list and handle them properly.

The main advertised address for a list should be filtered to this program,
through the mail wrapper.  E.g. for list `test@yourdomain.com', the `test'
alias would deliver to this script.

Stdin is the mail message, and argv[1] is the name of the target mailing list.
