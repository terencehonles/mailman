This file contains installation instructions for GNU Mailman, which is
configured using the standard GNU autoconf software.  You first need
to prepare your system as outlined in the sections below, and then
configure and install the Mailman software.

UPGRADING: Upgrading is usually as easy as just installing the new
version over the existing installation.  However, you should read the
notes in the file UPGRADING for important information before you
upgrade.


0. Installation requirements

    You must have the Python interpreter installed somewhere on your
    system.  Currently Python 2.0 or later is required.  For
    information about obtaining Python source code, RPM packages, or
    pre-compiled binaries please see:

        http://www.python.org

    You must also have an ANSI C compiler in order to build the
    wrapper programs which are used for improved security.  The GNU C
    compiler gcc 2.8.1 or later is known to work well.  For more
    information about obtaining gcc, see

        http://www.gnu.org

    Mailman 2.1 now requires the "email" package, which comes as part
    of Python 2.2.  If you are running an older version of Python,
    then you need to install the standalone email package by doing the
    following steps:

    % cd misc
    % tar zxf email-0.93.tar.gz
    % cd email-0.93
    % python setup.py install

    Check to make sure the email package is properly installed by
    doing the following:

    % python
    Python 2.1.1 (#1, Aug 31 2001, 17:07:00) 
    [GCC egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)] on linux2
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import email
    >>> email.__version__
    '0.93'

    (Note that if you are using Python 2.2, email.__version__ will be
    "1.0"; either version is fine.)


1. System setup

    You will need to be root to perform the steps in this section.

    Before installing the Mailman software, you need to prepare your
    system by adding certain users and groups.

    - Add a new user called `mailman'.  Typically this is added to
      your /etc/passwd file.  If username `mailman' is already in use,
      choose something else unique and see the --with-ownername flag
      below.

    - Add a new group called `mailman'.  Typically this is added to
      your /etc/group file.  The Mailman files will be installed under
      the `mailman' group, with the set-group-id bit.  Mailman's
      security is based on group-ownership permissions, so it is
      important to get this step right.  If groupname `mailman' is
      already in use, choose something else unique and see the
      --with-ownergroup below.

    - Create an installation directory (called $prefix in the
      documentation that follows).  All of the Mailman files will be
      installed under $prefix.  Run "configure --help" for ways to
      split the installation up based on read-only vs. read/write
      files.

      The default installation directory for Mailman 2.1 is
      /usr/local/mailman.  It used to be /home/mailman for all
      versions prior to Mailman 2.1alpha2.  You can override the
      default by using the --prefix option to configure (see below).
      If you're upgrading from a version previous to Mailman2.1alpha2,
      you will need to use --prefix unless you move your mailing
      lists.

      Watch out if your site does something like mount /usr/local with
      the nosuid option.  This will break Mailman, which relies on
      set-gid programs for its security.  If this describes your
      environment, simply install Mailman in a location that allows
      setgid programs.

      Make sure the install directory is set to group `mailman' (or
      whatever you're going to specify as --with-ownergroup) and has
      the setgid bit set (but see README.BSD if you're on a BSD
      system).  You probably also want to guarantee that this
      directory is readable and executable by everyone.  For example,
      these shell commands will accomplish this:

          % cd $prefix
          % chgrp mailman .
          % chmod a+rx,g+ws .

      You are now ready to configure and install the Mailman software.


2. Running configure

    TAKE SPECIAL NOTE OF THE --with-mail-gid AND --with-cgi-gid
    OPTIONS BELOW.  YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO USE THESE!

    You should not be root while performing the steps in this section.
    Do them under your own login, or whatever account you typically
    install software as.  You do not need to do these steps as user
    mailman, but you could.

    Make sure that you have write permissions to the target
    installation directory, and permission to create a setgid file in
    the file system where it resides (NFS and other mounts can be
    configured to inhibit setgid settings).

    If you've installed other GNU software, you should be familiar
    with the configure script.  Usually you can just cd to the
    directory you unpacked Mailman into, and run configure with no
    arguments:

        % cd mailman-<version>
        % ./configure
        % make install

    The following options allow you to customize your Mailman
    installation.

      --prefix=<dir>
            Standard GNU configure option which changes the base
            directory that Mailman is installed into.  By default
            $prefix is /usr/local/mailman.  This directory must
            already exist, and be set up as described in section 1
            above.

      --exec-prefix=<dir>
            Standard GNU configure option which lets you specify a
            different installation directory for architecture
            dependent binaries.

      --with-var-prefix=<dir>
            Store mutable data under <dir> instead of under the prefix
            or exec_prefix.

      --with-python=</path/to/python>
            Specify an alternative Python interpreter to use for the
            wrapper programs.  The default is to use the interpreter
            found first on your shell's $PATH.  Note that when running
            the scripts from the command line, the first Python
            interpreter found on $PATH is always used.

      --with-username=<username-or-uid>
            Specify a different username than `mailman' to use as a
            default.  Use this only if the username `mailman' is
            already in use by somebody (e.g. Mark Ailman's login
            name).  This switch can take an integer user id or a user
            name.  Be sure your $prefix directory is owned by this
            user.

      --with-groupname=<groupname-or-gid>
            Specify a different groupname than `mailman' to use as a
            default.  Use this only if the groupname `mailman' is
            already in use.  This switch can take an integer group id
            or a group name.  Be sure your $prefix directory is
            group-owned by this group.

      --with-mail-gid=<group-or-groups>
            Specify an alternative group for running scripts via the
            mail wrapper.  <group-or-groups> can be a list of one or
            more integer group ids or symbolic group names.  The first
            value in the list that resolves to an existing group is
            used.  By default, the value is the list `other daemon'.

            This is highly system dependent and you must get this
            right, because the group id is compiled into the mail
            wrapper program for added security.  On systems using
            sendmail, the sendmail.cf configuration file designates
            the group id of sendmail processes using the "DefaultUser"
            option.  (If commented out, it still may be indicating the
            default...)

            Check your MTA's documentation and configuration files to
            find the right value for this switch.

      --with-cgi-gid=<group-or-groups>
            Specify an alternative group for running scripts via the
            CGI wrapper.  <group-or-groups> can be a list of one or
            more integer group ids or symbolic group names.  The first
            value in the list that resolves to an existing group is
            used.  By default, the value is the the list `www www-data
            nobody'.

            The proper value for this is dependent on your web server
            configuration.  You must get this right, because the group
            id is compiled into the CGI wrapper program for added
            security, and no Mailman CGI scripts will run if this is
            incorrect.

            If you're using Apache, check the values for the `Group'
            option in your httpd.conf file.

      --with-cgi-ext=<extension>
            Specify an extension for cgi-bin programs.  The CGI
            wrappers placed in $PREFIX/cgi-bin will have this
            extension (some web servers require an extension).
            <extension> must include the dot.

      --with-gcc=no
            Don't use gcc, even if it is found.  `cc' must be found on
            your $PATH.


3. Check your installation

    After you've run "make install", you can check that your
    installation has all the correct permissions and group ownerships
    by running the check_perms script:

    - cd to $prefix

    - Run bin/check_perms

    Don't try to run bin/check_perms from the source directory; it
    will only run from the install (i.e. $prefix) directory.

    If this reports no problems, then it's very likely <wink> that
    your installation is set up correctly.  If it reports problems,
    then you can either fix them manually, re-run the installation, or
    use check_perms to fix the problems (probably the easiest
    solution):

    - You need to become the user that did the installation (and that
      owns all the files in $prefix), or root.

    - Run bin/check_perms -f

    - Repeat previous step until no more errors are reported!


4. Final system set-up

    Congratulations!  You've installed the Mailman software.  To get
    everything running you need to hook Mailman up to both your web
    server and your mail system.

    - If there is a README.<yourMTA> file that describes your mail
      server (MTA), read it now.  Some MTAs are more compatible with
      Mailman such that you can do automatic creation and removal of
      mailing lists, including through-the-web operations.  Examples
      are Exim and Postfix.  Setup instructions for specific MTAs are
      contained in these README files.

    - If you plan on running your MTA and web server on different
      machines, sharing Mailman installations via NFS, be sure that
      the clocks on those two machines are synchronized closely.  You
      might take a look at the file Mailman/LockFile.py; the constant
      CLOCK_SLOP helps the locking mechanism compensate for clock skew
      in this type of environment.

    - Configure your web server to give $prefix/cgi-bin permission to
      run CGI scripts.  You probably need to be root to do this.

      The line you should add might look something like the following
      (with the real absolute directory substituted for $prefix, of
      course):

          Exec          /mailman/*      $prefix/cgi-bin/*
      or:
          ScriptAlias   /mailman/       $prefix/cgi-bin/

      Consult your web server's documentation for details.

    - You want to be very sure that the user id under which your CGI
      scripts run is *not* in the `mailman' group you created above,
      otherwise private archives will be accessible to anyone.

    - Copy the Mailman, Python, and GNU logos to a location accessible
      to your web server.  E.g. with Apache, you've usually got an
      `icons' directory that you can drop the images into.  You want
      to copy $prefix/icons/mailman.jpg, $prefix/icons/PythonPowered.png,
      and $prefix/icons/gnu-head-tiny.jpg to this directory.

      You then want to add a line to your $prefix/Mailman/mm_cfg.py
      file which sets the base URL for the logos.  For example:

      IMAGE_LOGOS = '/images/'

      The default value for IMAGE_LOGOS is '/icons/'.  Read the
      comment in Defaults.py.in for details.

    - Configure your web server to point to the Pipermail public
      mailing list archives:

      For example, in Apache:

         Alias /pipermail/ $varprefix/archives/public/

      where $varprefix is usually $prefix unless you've used the
      --with-var-prefix option to configure.

      Consult your web server's documentation for details.  Also be
      sure to configure your web server to follow symbolic links in
      this directory, otherwise public Pipermail archives won't be
      accessible.  For Apache users, consult the FollowSymLinks
      option.

      Now restart your web server.

    - Set up the crontab entries.  Mailman runs a number of cron jobs
      for its basic functionality.  In version of Mailman prior to
      2.1alpha2, setting up your crontab was imperative to getting
      Mailman to work.  With MM2.1alpha2 and later though, the qrunner
      is started from the bin/mailmanctl script (see below) instead of
      cron.  You still want to set up crontab to run the ancillary
      scripts, but it isn't as crucial to getting Mailman working as
      it once was.  Note that if you're upgrading from a previous
      version of Mailman, you'll want to install the new crontab, but
      be careful if you're running multiple Mailman installations on
      your site!  Changing the crontab could mess with other parallel
      Mailman installations.

      If your version of crontab supports the -u option, you must be
      root to do this next step.  Add $prefix/cron/crontab.in as a
      crontab entry by executing these commands:

          % cd $prefix/cron
          % crontab -u mailman crontab.in

      If you used the --with-ownername option, use that user name
      instead of mailman for the -u argument value.  If your crontab
      does not support the -u option, try these commands:

          % cd $prefix/cron
          % su - mailman
          % crontab crontab.in

    - Start the Mailman qrunner daemon, by executing the following
      from the $prefix directory:

          % bin/mailmanctl start

      If you want to start Mailman every time you reboot your system,
      and your OS supports the chkconfig command (e.g. RedHat and
      Mandrake Linuxes) you can simply do the following (as root, from
      the Mailman source directory):

          % cp misc/mailman /etc/init.d/mailman
          % chkconfig --add mailman

      (Note that /etc/init.d may be /etc/rc.d/init.d on some systems.)

      For Unixes that don't support chkconfig, simply copy
      misc/mailman as above, then set up the following symbolic links,
      again as root:

          % cp misc/mailman /etc/init.d
          % cd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman K12mailman
          % cd ../rc1.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman K12mailman
          % cd ../rc2.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman S98mailman
          % cd ../rc3.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman S98mailman
          % cd ../rc4.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman S98mailman
          % cd ../rc5.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman S98mailman
          % cd ../rc6.d
          % ln -s ../init.d/mailman K12mailman

    - Create a "site-wide" mailing list.  This is the one that
      password reminders will appear to come from.  Usually this
      should be the "mailman" mailing list, but if you need to change
      this, be sure to change the MAILMAN_SITE_LIST variable in
      mm_cfg.py (see below).

      % bin/newlist mailman

    - You should then subscribe yourself to the mailman list.


5. Customize Mailman

    You should do these steps using the account you installed Mailman
    under in section 2 above.

    - The file $prefix/Mailman/Defaults.py contains a number of
      defaults for your installation.  If any of these are incorrect,
      override them in $prefix/Mailman/mm_cfg.py, NOT IN Defaults.py!
      See the comments in Defaults.py for details.  Once a list is
      created, editing many of these variables will have no effect.
      At that point, you'll need to configure your lists through the
      web admin interface or through the command line script
      bin/config_list or bin/withlist.

      Specifically check to make sure the variables DEFAULT_HOST_NAME
      and DEFAULT_URL are correct.  The latter MUST end in a slash.

      The install process will not overwrite an existing mm_cfg.py
      file so you can freely make changes to this file.

      Note: Do *not* change HOME_DIR or MAILMAN_DIR.  These are set
      automatically by the configure script.

    - Create the site password using:

        % $prefix/bin/mmsitepass <your-site-password>

      This password can be used anywhere that individual user or
      mailing list administrator passwords are required, giving the
      mailman site administrator the ability to adjust these things
      when necessary.

      You may also want to create a password for the site-wide "list
      creator" role (someone other than the site administrator who as
      privileges to create and remove lists through the web).  Use the
      -c option to mmsitepass to set this.


6. Getting started

    See the README file under the section "CREATE YOUR FIRST LIST" for
    a quick introduction to creating an initial test list.


7. Troubleshooting
  
    If you encounter problems with running Mailman, first check the
    "Common Problems" section, below.  If your problem is not covered
    there, check the FAQ.  Then check for a log entry from Mailman in
    your syslog and in the $prefix/logs/error file.
    
    Where syslog lives on your particular machine may vary.  It may be
    in /var/log/maillog.  It may also be in /var/log/syslog.  On many
    machines, syslog files live in /adm/log/ instead of /var/log.

    If you encounter an error, send an error report to
    mailman-users@python.org.  Include a description of what you're
    doing to cause the problem, and the relevant lines from your
    syslog.  Also include information on your operating system, which
    version of Python you're using, and which version of Mailman
    you're installing.


8. Common Problems

    Problem:  All Mailman web pages give a 404 File not found error.

    Solution: Your web server has not been set up properly for handling
              Mailman's cgi commands.  Make sure you've:

              1) Configured the web server to give permissions to
                 $prefix/cgi-bin
              2) Restarted the web server properly.

              Consult your web server's documentation for instructions
              on how to do these things.


    Problem:  All Mailman web pages give an "Internal Server Error".

    Solution: The likely problem is that you are using the wrong GID or 
              UID for CGI scripts.  Check your syslog.  If you see, for
              example, a line like: 

                  Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99

              You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify $CGI_GID to be 51,
              as described in the installation instructions.


    Problem:  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying the
              list is not found!

    Solution: You probably didn't add the necessary aliases to the system
              alias database, given to you when you ran the newlist
              command.  If you did add them, you likely did not update
              the alias database, or your system requires you to run
              newaliases explicitly.  Refer to section 5 above for
              more information.


    Problem:  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying,
              "unknown mailer error".

    Solution: The likely problem is that you are using the wrong GID or 
              UID for mail.  Check your syslog.  If you see, for
              example, a line like:

                  Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99

              You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify $MAIL_GID to
              be 51, as described in the installation
              instructions. see notes on Postfix below, as by default
              it will create these problems on installation.


    Problem:  I use Postfix for my MTA and the mail wrapper programs
              are logging complaints about the wrong GID.

    Solution: Create a separate aliases file for Postfix in its
              main.cf config file under the variable "alias_maps". Put
              the file somewhere in Mailman's home directory, or
              somewhere else where the user mailman has write access
              to it; *as user mailman* call Postfix's "postalias" on the
              alias file.  

              % postalias <the alias file>

              Also as user mailman, run 

              % python -c'import os; print os.getgid()' 
              
              This should print out the group id that Mailman should
              be configured to expect when the mail wrapper programs
              are run.  Call it "thegid".  Rebuild Mailman with

              % ./configure --with-mail-gid=thegid

              See also the README.POSTFIX file for more information on
              connecting Postfix and Mailman.


    Problem:  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying,
              "sh: wrapper not available for sendmail programs"

    Solution: Your system uses sendmail restricted shell (smrsh).  You
              need to configure smrsh by creating a symbolic link from
              the mail wrapper ($prefix/mail/wrapper) to the directory
              identifying executables allowed to run under smrsh.

              Some common names for this directory are
              /var/admin/sm.bin, /usr/admin/sm.bin or /etc/smrsh.

              Note that on Debian Linux, the system makes
              /usr/lib/sm.bin, which is wrong, you will need to create
              the directory /usr/admin/sm.bin and add the link there.
              Note further any aliases newaliases spits out will need
              to be adjusted to point to the secure link to the
              wrapper.


    Problem:  I messed up when I called configure.  How do I clean
              things up and re-install?

    Solution: % make clean
              % ./configure --with-the-right-options
              % make install
