This file contains installation instructions.  Mailman is now
configured using the standard GNU autoconf software.  You should first
set up your system as outlined in the sections below, and then
configure and install the Mailman software.

0. Installation requirements

    You must have the Python interpreter installed somewhere on your
    system.  Currently Python 1.5 or later is required.  For
    information about obtaining Python source code, or pre-compiled
    binaries please see the Python Web site at

        <http://www.python.org/>

    You must also have a C compiler in order to build the wrapper
    programs which are used for improved security.  The GNU C compiler 
    gcc 2.8.1 is known to work well.  For more information about
    obtaining gcc, see

        <http://www.gnu.org/>

1. System setup

    You will need to be root to perform the steps in this section.

    Before installing the Mailman software, you need to prepare your
    system by adding certain users and groups.

    - Add a new user called `mailman'.  Typically this is added to
      your /etc/passwd file.

    - Add a new group called `mailman'.  Typically this is added to
      your /etc/group file.  The Mailman files will be installed under
      the `mailman' group, with the set-group-id bit.  This is so both 
      the Web based and mail based programs will have the proper write 
      permissions.

    - Make sure you also have the following user ids:
        nobody
        daemon

      and the following groups:
        nobody
        mail

      These user and group ids are compiled into the wrapper programs
      for improved security.  If you don't want to or can't added
      these users and groups, see below for specifying alternative
      user and group ids for the wrapper programs.

    - Create an installation directory (called $prefix in the
      documentation that follows).  All of the Mailman files will be
      installed under $prefix.  

      Note that if you've added a mailman user, and plan to install to
      the default location (/home/mailman), that directory may have
      already been made for you.

      Make sure this directory is set to group `mailman' and has the
      group sticky bit set.  For example, these shell commands will
      accomplish this:

          % cd $prefix
          % chgrp mailman .
          % chmod g+s .

      You are now ready to configure and install the Mailman software.

2. Running configure

    You do not need to be root to perform the steps in the section.
    Do them under your own login, or whatever account you typically
    install software as.  However, make sure that you have write
    permissions to the directory you'll be installing into.

    - If you've installed other GNU software, you should be familar
      with the configure script.  Usually you can just cd to the
      directory you unpacked Mailman into, and run configure with no
      arguments:

          % cd <mailman-src-dir>
          % ./configure

      and then run `make install'.  The following options allow you to 
      customize your Mailman installation.

      --prefix=dir
            Standard GNU configure option which changes the base
            directory that Mailman is installed into.  By default
            $prefix is /home/mailman.  This directory must already
            exist, and be set up as described in section 1 above.

      --exec_prefix=dir
            Standard GNU configure option which lets you specify a
            different installation directory for architecture
            dependent binaries.

      --with-python=/path/to/python
            Specify an alternative Python interpreter to use for the
            wrapper programs.  The default is to use the interpreter
            found first on your shell's $PATH.  Note that when running
            the scripts from the command line, the first Python
            interpreter found on $PATH is always used.

      --with-gcc=no
            Don't use gcc, even if it is found.  `cc' must be found on
            your $PATH

      Also, a number of shell environment variables can be used on the
      configure command line to customize things.

      $CC         The C compiler to use

      $CGI_UID    The uid to use in the CGI wrapper (default is
                  the uid for the user `nobody')

      $CGI_GID    The gid to use in the CGI wrapper (default is
                  the gid for the group `nobody')

      $MAIL_UID   The uid to use in the mail wrapper (default is
                  the uid for the user `daemon)

      $MAIL_GID   The gid to use in the CGI wrapper (default is
                  the gid for the group `mail')

      For example, to set $MAIL_GID to 20 instead of the default,
      users of csh or tcsh should type:

            % setenv MAIL_GID 20

      Users of bash, ksh and similar shells should type:

            % export MAIL_GID=20

      or, you can invoke configure like so:

            % MAIL_GID=20 ./configure

      For $CGI_UID and $CGI_GID, consult your Web server's
      documentation.  This uid and gid should match the user and group 
      that the Web server will use to execute CGI scripts.

      For $MAIL_UID and $MAIL_GID, consult your sendmail documentation
      or sendmail.cf file.  This is the user and group that your mail
      delivery will use to execute filter programs.

    - Run `make install'

3. Final system set-up

    - Configure your web server to give $prefix/cgi-bin permission to
      run CGI scripts, and restart your Web server.  You probably need 
      to be root to do this.

      The line you should add might look something like the following
      (with the real absolute directory substituted for $prefix, of
      course):

          Exec          /mailman/*      $prefix/cgi-bin/*
      or:
          ScriptAlias   /mailman/       $prefix/cgi-bin/

      Consult your Web server's documentation for details.

    - Add `mailman' as a trusted mail user.  You probably need to be
      root to do this.  This is usually done by adding the following
      line to your /etc/sendmail.cf file:

          Tmailman

      under the line that says

          Troot

    - Set up the crontab entries.  Mailman runs a number of cron jobs
      to do things such as send out password reminders, etc.  You need
      to be user `mailman' to perform this step.  Add
      $prefix/cron/crontab.in as a crontab entry by executing these
      commands:

          % su - mailman
          % cd $prefix/cron
          % crontab crontab.in

    - Add aliases for `mailman' and `owner-mailman' to the system's
      mail alias database.  These aliases should point to whoever is
      ultimately responsible for the Mailman installation.  Here are
      instructions for those running sendmail:

          1. su to root.
          2. Assuming your email is fred@flintstone.com, add the following
             lines to the file /etc/aliases:
 
             mailman: fred@flintstone.com
             mailman-owner: mailman

          3. Some versions of sendmail require you to run the program
             'newaliases' explicitly.

      If you don't run sendmail, consult the documentation of your mail 
      transport program for information on adding these aliases.

4. Customize Mailman

    You should do these steps using the account you installed Mailman
    under in section 2 above.

    - Check the file $prefix/Mailman/mm_cfg.py for accuracy.
      Specifically check to make sure the variables DEFAULT_HOST_NAME
      and DEFAULT_URL are correct, and make any necessary changes.

      The variable settings in mm_cfg.py override those in
      $prefix/Mailman/mm_defaults.py, so consult that file for
      defaults.  Add any additonal settings that you want to change
      for your site to mm_cfg.py (don't edit mm_defaults.py).

      The install process will not overwrite an existing mm_cfg.py
      file so you can freely make changes to this file.  Installing
      will always copy the automatically generated mm_cfg.py file to
      $prefix/Mailman/mm_cfg.py.dist so you can check that file any
      useful differences or suggestions.

      Note: Do *not* change HOME_DIR or MAILMAN_DIR.  These are set
      automatically by the configure script.

    - Create the site password using:

        % $prefix/bin/mmsitepass <your-site-password>

    - Point an external archiver at the public and private archives.
      We recommend Andrew Kuchling's Pipermail, which can be found at: 

          <http://starship.skyport.net/crew/amk/maintained/pipermail.html>

      Future releases of Mailman will probably come bundled with
      Pipermail.

5. Getting started

    - Create a list named `test'.  To do so, run the program
      $prefix/bin/newlist.  You will be prompted for the name of the
      list, as well as the email address of the person running the
      list.  Put your own email address as the list administrator's
      address.
       
    - Running newlist will generate a list of aliases that must be
      added to the system.  If you are running Sendmail, you may add
      the lines output directly to the file /etc/aliases.  You may
      need to run the command 'newaliases' (all as root).  Now the
      mailing address for your list as well as its administrative
      addresses will be set up.  If you are not running Sendmail,
      consult your MUA's documentation for information on adding
      aliases.

    - You will receive email instructions on how to visit the list you
      just created.  Using these instructions, subscribe to the
      mailing list.  Once you have subscribed (which requires a
      confirmation step!), send a message to the list, and see if you
      get it.  If so, then you have successfully installed Mailman,
      and set up your first list!


6. Troubleshooting
  
    If you encounter problems with running Mailman, first check the
    "Common Problems" section, below.  If your problem is not covered
    there, then check for a log entry from Mailman in your syslog.
    
    Where syslog lives on your particular machine may vary.  It may be
    in /var/log/maillog.  It may also be in /var/log/syslog.  On many
    machines, syslog files live in /adm/log/ instead of
    /var/log.

    If you encounter an error, send an error report to
    mailman-users@python.org.  Include a description of what you're
    doing to cause the problem, and the relevant lines from your
    syslog.  Also include information on your operating system and
    version of Python.

7. Common Problems

    Problem:  All Mailman web pages give a 404 File not found error.

    Solution: Your web server has not been set up properly for handling
              Mailman's cgi commands.  Make sure you've:

              1) Configured the web server to give permissions to
                 $prefix/cgi-bin
              2) Restarted the web server properly.

              Consult your web server's documentation for instructions
              on how to do these things.


    Problem:  All Mailman web pages give an "Internal Server Error".

    Solution: The likely problem is that you are using the wrong GID or 
              UID for CGI scripts.  Check your syslog.  If you see, for
              example, a line like: 

                  Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99

              You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify $CGI_GID to be 51,
              as described in the installation instructions.


    Problem:  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying the
              list is not found!

    Solution: You probably didn't add the necessary aliases to the system
              alias database, given to you when you ran the newlist
              command.  If you did add them, you likely did not update
              the alias database, or your system requires you to run
              newaliases explicitly.  Refer to section 5 above for
              more information.


    Problem:  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying,
              "unknown mailer error".

    Solution: The likely problem is that you are using the wrong GID or 
              UID for mail.  Check your syslog.  If you see, for
              example, a line like:

                  Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99

              You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify $MAIL_GID to
              be 51, as described in the installation instructions.
