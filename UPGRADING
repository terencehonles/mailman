For the most part, mailling lists upgrade themselves with the new
versions.  However, there are some changes in the filesystem that need
to be taken care of separately.  running "make update" takes care of
this for you.  If you still have problems upgrading after running
this, or want to integrate mbox archives into the pipermail archiving,
read on.

"make update" creates a file named "update.log" in the top level of
the source distribution.  If the script that updates the mailman
filesystem encounters something that is not resolvable, it will log
info about this to "update.log".  This might be worth checking.

Below is an annotated listing of the things that "make upgrade" does.
Hopefully, this will help resolve any problems you are having.

- Archiving files are moved around as part of integrating pipermail
  into mailman.  In particular, 

  1) if a list has only a private mbox archive
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname> is moved to 
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname>.mbox/<listname> 

  2) if a list has only a public mbox archive
  $prefix/archives/public/<listname> is moved to
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname>.mbox/<listname>
  and
  a symlink is made that points
  $prefix/archives/public/<listname>.mbox to
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname>.mbox/<listname>

  3) if a list has both private and public mbox archives, 
  make update picks one of the above 2 configurations based on whether
  or not the list currently is archived publicly.  It then renames the  
  other mbox to mbox.preb6.

  4) if a list used recent cvs sources, where archives were placed in
  $prefix/public_html/archives, then these are moved to
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname> and a symlink is made from
  $prefix/archives/public/<listname> to that spot if the list's
  archives are public.  Also, a permissions-related security  problem
  is removed. 

  To integrate mbox archives of old lists, log in as mailman and run 
  $prefix/bin/arch <listname> <path-to-mbox-archive>.

  Also, by default, beta6 does both mbox and html based archiving, you
  can configure mailman to do one, both, or neither.  please see
  $prefix/Mailman/Defaults.py for details.

- If upgrading from version 1.0b4 or earlier, you will have to move
  list-specific templates.  For each list, move
  $prefix/templates/<listname>/* to $prefix/lists/<listname>.  Please
  reference the generic templates in $prefix/templates to see if any
  variables have changed (There shouldn't be many, only options.html
  was updated from b5 to b6).
