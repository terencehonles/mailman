Mailman 1.0b2 (README $Revision: 452 $, $Date: 1998-04-13 21:17:41 +0100 (Mon, 13 Apr 1998) $)

This is mailman, maillist management software written mostly in
Python.  Mailman was originally developed by John Viega.  Ken
Manheimer picked it up after substantial revisions of the development
version were lost in a system crash, and refined some of the rough
edges, enough so that mailman is now the production system for
python.org.  We expect to continue to develop mailman, and see
blossoming of this very promising foundation as other people join in.

Initial version of Mailman (v. 0.9) written by John Viega Dec 12-15
1996.  Mailman 1.0b2 and 1.0b1.1 developments by ken manheimer,
04/13/1998.

For anyone interested in joining the development crowd, or just
tracking the progress, there's a maillist for you to join:

more info (and for an example of the system in action).

See file DONE for info on changes since v. 0.9

Features:
  o Most standard mailing list features, including:
	moderation, mail based commands, digests, etc...
  o An extensive web interface customizable on a per-list basis.
  o Web based list administration interface for *all* admin-type tasks.
  o Automatic web based hypermail-style archives (using pipermail or
    other external archiver), including provisions for private archives
  o Smart bounce detection and correction
  o Fast bulk mailing
  o Smart spam protection
  o Extendable logging
  o Multiple list owners and moderators
  o Optional MIME-Compliant digests
  o Nice about which machine you subscribed from if you're from the
	right domain.

Requirements:
  You must be root on a machine running a mail transport program that
	uses an /etc/aliases file, and has a sendmail executable (smail
	should be OK).  (We should soon be switching over to direct
	SMTP connection to whatever you have running on port 25.)
  The machine really needs to have a web server in order to configure lists.

Install:
  o Make sure Python is installed as /usr/local/bin/python (currently
	hardcoded -- this obviously needs to change, and should be
	handled by a config program)
  o As root, add a mailman user
  o As mailman, copy the mailman dir to /home/mailman.  Currently the
    system requires the source be located there.  [I've been running
    with the untarred mailman dir as a subdir of /home/mailman, so eg
    maillist.py, the main mailman list object module, is situated as
    /home/mailman/mailman/maillist.py.]
  o As mailman, in /home/mailman make public_html, cgi-bin, and logs
    directories.  Chmod them g+sw.
  o As mailman, in /home/mailman make archives/private and archives/public
    directories.  Chmod them g+sw.
  o Copy /home/mailman/mailman/misc/Cookie.py to /home/mailman/cgi-bin 
  o As root, Configure your web server to give /home/mailman/cgi-bin
    perms to run cgi in the cgi-bin dir, and restart the web server.
    The line you should add should look something like:
	Exec    /mailman/*      /home/mailman/cgi-bin/*
	or:
	ScriptAlias /mailman/   /home/mailman/cgi-bin/

    (Or whatever is equivalent for your web server)
  o As root, edit /home/mailman/mailman/src/*.c and edit the UID and
    GID const lines as appropriate.
  o As root, cd to /home/mailman/mailman/src and type: make
  o As root, Add mailman as a trusted mail user.  This is usually done
    by adding: Tmailman to /etc/sendmail.cf under the line: Troot
  o As root, Restart sendmail.
  o As mailman, cd to /home/mailman/mailman/cron, and add crontab.in
    as your crontab.  (probably done w/: crontab crontab.in)
  o Edit mailman/modules/mm_cfg.py - if you don't already have one, make a
    copy from mailman/modules/mm_cfg.py.dist.  Include settings in mm_cfg.py
    for any of the defaults in mm_defaults.py that you want to tailor
    for your site.
  o Create the site password, if you don't already have one, using
    'mailman/bin/mmsitepass password'.
  o Point external archiver at public and private archives (we recommend
    http://starship.skyport.net/crew/amk/maintained/pipermail.html ).

Adding a new list:
  o Run the program bin/newlist

List managers, note that:

  o Being a list administrator does not entail receiving the traffic - 
    you have to subscribe, as well.
  o Relevant urls - the DEFAULT_URL plus:
    - mailman/listinfo/listname for public view of list
    - mailman/admin/listname for options
    - mailman/admindb/listname for pending requests
    - and generally, mailman/listinfo for the list of (public) lists


Troubleshooting:

    Many of the scripts have their stderr logged to
    ~mailman/logs/error, and some of the modules log caught errors
    conditions there, as well, so you should check there at least
    occasionally to look for bugs in the code and problems in your
    setup.

    One thing that is *not* caught by stderr hook is syntax errors!
    However, just about all files **except** cron/mailpasswds can be
    run from the command line with no arguments, and no effect.  So
    you can and should use the python interpreter to check the syntax
    of any changes before trying them out.

If the web pages hang:

	CERN web servers might leave python's running, and in some
	cases might hang the cgi completely.  In that case, switch to
	Apache.

If from the web you get "document contains no data":
If mail isn't getting delivered:
	The cgi wrappers are failing.  Either a UID is wrong, or your
	web server / mailer has a non-standard name.

How to add a new user option

    You'll need to do some of these things and not others.

	1) Add a flag to mm_defaults.py, and mm_cfg.py.dist if it's
	   likely to require a custom value for each site.
	2) Add an entry to mm_html GetStandardReplacements name
	 & mapping, to enable referring to the value from mailman html.
	3) Add replacements lines to the cgi/options and cgi/listinfo
	   scripts, to hook the mailman html up with the option.
	4) For user-specific options, make SetUserOption calls in
	 & cgi/handle_opts.
	5) For user-specific options, add to 2 data structs at top of
	 &  mm_mailcmd.
	6) For user-specific options, add description to mm_mailcmd help
	7) Update templates if the options have replacements
	8) Use your option wherever appropriate...

Interactive python sessions with maillists

    You can do substantial things with maillists from th interpreter!
    Cd to the modules subdir and, with '.' on your pythonpath, start
    the interpreter and import maillist and mm_utils.  You can
    instantiate the maillist of your choice, eg for a list named
    postal:

>>> l = maillist.MailList('postal')

    If the list is active, and you aren't going to be saving any
    changes, do an l.Unlock() immediately.  (Otherwise, anyone visiting 
    a web interface involving the list, or postings going to the list,
    will be held awaiting the lock.)  Now you can examine various
    aspects of the list:

>>> l.members
['klm@python.org']
>>> l.digest_members
[]
>>> l.real_name
'Postal'
>>> l._internal_name
'postal'

    dir(l) will present the components of the list. maillists.py has
    the descriptions of many of the components, though some are defined
    in other modules.

    If you want to save changes, 'l.Save()' will do it.  It's a real
    good idea to play with trial lists, first, before doing surgery
    with this method on production lists.

    When you do get comfortable with it, you use it and a utility
    routine, mm_utils.mm_utils.map_maillists(), to do wholesale changes
    on all your lists.  It takes a function argument, and applies that
    function to every one of the lists on your system.  For instance,
    to get the names of all the lists on your system which are
    advertised:

>>> import maillist, mm_utils
>>> def advertised(l):
...    if l.advertised: return l.real_name
...
>>> filter(None, mm_utils.map_maillists(advertised))
['Mailman-developers', 'Meta-sig', 'Python-Help', 'C++-SIG',
'Matrix-SIG', 'DB-SIG', 'DO-SIG', 'Doc-SIG', 'GUI-SIG', 'Image-SIG',
'Objc-SIG', 'Plot-SIG', 'Pythonmac-SIG', 'String-SIG', 'Thread-SIG',
'Grail', 'XML-SIG', 'JPython-Interest']

    If you do list surgery with this mechanism, double check that
    you're doing what you intend before having the routine do l.Save()'s.
