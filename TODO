The Mailman TODO list

*Bugs
- Turning off bounce processing doesn't seem to work.
- Turning on non-member post exclusion doesn't seem to work.
- "Stale" addresses don't update properly when new bounces come in 
(stale means we had some bounces, but delivery to that address started 
working again before we booted them from the list)

*Documentation
- A FAQ (esp. for the web page)
- A detailed feature list
- A user's guide
- A site-admin's guide
- A list-admin's guide
- More in-place documentation
- A developer's guide w/ Architecture and API info, etc.

*General Web UI
- Add a navigation sidebar to all web pages - central links, and
list-specific links for list-specific pages.
- Implement cookies for edithtml and admindb
- Make sure when settings are changed, there is always some sort of 
confirmation!

*List Admin UI
- The list admin should be able to turn off the security mechanisms such as 
confirmation and passwords if he deems it necessary.
- Make it so mass-subscribe doesn't hang waiting for the mail transport to 
do all delivery. (This may have been done w/ the admin cookie patches?)
- Time out admin requests, and have them auto-fail after that period.
- Allow the admin to edit posts in the database (put a header in the post 
noting that it was edited by a moderator, however!)
- Have the option for moderator passwords, so that moderators don't have 
access to the general list options.
- An -urgent address for each list that may only be posted to by the list 
admin.  It will seem to be sent to the whole list, but will deliver to 
everyone ASAP, and not wait for digests.
- A web UI to the -urgent address.
- Better options for the policy on bundling digests (periodic w/ arbitrary 
periods, size based, a combo of the two, etc).
- A button that will bundle a digest right now (tm).
- A generic error template page.
- An option for setting the precedence header.
- Make the MM-tags accept useful options where appropriate.
- Revamp the admindb user interface, it's fairly clunky (include a decent 
cataloging mechanism based on the file system).

*List Member UI
- Editing your user options should put you back to the edit-options page. 
- Allow the user to be excluded from postings if they're getting them
in the to: or cc: headers.
- An option to change your email address.
- Allow users to specify a different address for password reminders
(w/ confirmation), or come up w/ a better strategy for remailing lists
(could be done as the default, given a generic filter mechanism).

*Site Administrator's UI
- Make a web based site admin UI for adding lists, deleting lists, etc.
- Use a better storage mechanism for the site admin password
- Improve list deletion by requiring a valid password (from the shell script)

*Email Handling
- Implement a reasonable administrivia filter (but less likely to misfire than
majordomo's).
- Implement a more general (form-based, like the netscape email
filter) filtering/bouncing/etc. mechanism.
- Allow for programs to run that perform filtering / reformatting.
- Set asside messages IMMEDIATELY as a rescue mechanism... make sure no
  mails are ever lost, even if there turned out to be a bad Mailman bug.

*Mailcmd interface
- Provide an email interface to administrative commands.

*Portability concerns
- Use portable file locking
- Replace cron stuff with our own scheduling mechanism
- Provide a way to get list mail from another machine so the SMTP server
  doesn't have to live on the same machine as the web server + mailman.
  The easiest thing to do would be to use something like fetchmail to poll
  a pop3 port.  However, we could have a program that runs on the SMTP server,
  and just copies mail over to the other machine.

*Bounce handling
- Add more patterns for bounce handling
- Occasionally remove stale bounce entries
- Send mail to people that are being removed w/o their knowlege (even though
they're likely not to get it).
- Clean the code up, make it more robust and efficent (see also bugs)

*Pipermail + Archiving mechanism
- Hook it back up in the default distribution
- Search engine for archives
- Format the list of archives nicely by default, perhaps in a table:
<table border=3>
<tr><td>Archive</td> <td>Date</td><td>View by:</td></tr>     
<tr><td>Vol. 1</td> <td>Q4, 1998</td><td>DATE THREAD AUTHOR </td></tr> 
</table>
(Date thread and author would all be links)
- Provide downloadable tar.gz's of the archives
- When a list switches on archiving, automatically do the archiving 
  regularly (right now you have to install a cron script).

*Code cleanup
- Use the re module where regexp and regsub are used.
- Refine any remaining unqualified exception guards to specify target 
  exceptions, when appropriate.
- Turn standard mailman exceptions into class exceptions.
- Seperate edit-options from the subscribe script.
- Encapsulate all modules into a python package.
- Remove dead code, etc.

*Misc
- Automatically update aliases again?
- Make the listinfo pages static, and have them regenerate when options are 
changed, or html is edited.
- Make it so Mailman can run as a threaded server (this feature should be 
optional).
- The threaded server should be able to off its workload to friendly machines 
if it is overworked (distributed support).
- Refine locking to lock only necessary sections to get rid of superfluous
contention.
- Implement member profiles, using a class to store name,
organization, description, etc, and default option settings.  The
lists still can have their own data, but the user can set defaults in
their profile...
