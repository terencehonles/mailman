TODO for mailman 1.0b2 (TODO $Revision: 514 $, $Date: 1998-05-04 18:10:02 +0100 (Mon, 04 May 1998) $)

This document is by no means up to date, sorry.

For after v 1.0b3:
------------
Pending bugs
------------
 - Bounce processing
   - Turning off bounce processing doesn't?
   - Turning on non-member-post exclusion doesn't
   - More generally mm_utils.AddressesMatch() needs to be really
     thought out.  For instance, klm@python.org vs klm@acm.org should
     be seen as different, but klm@parrot.python.org and
     klm@larch.python.org and klm@python.org should probably be seen
     as the same.  There may be more criteria...
 - Extremely little documentation.  (Aside from the README, some online
   admin help, the code, and the developers community,
   mailman-developers@python.org...)
-------------------------------
Pending Developments and Issues
-------------------------------

Some moderate Pending Refinements:

 - Use re module everywhere instead of regexp and regsub.
 - Add navigation sidebar to all web pages - central links, and
   list-specific links for list-specific web pages.
 - Provide user option by which list members are excluded from
   postings which they're already getting via inclusion on message to:
   or cc: headers.
 - Improve recognition of "fuzzy same" addresses (necessary for to: and cc:
   recognition in previous item)
 - Implement a reasonable administrivia filter for lists (but less
   likely to misfire than majordomo's) (administrivia is, eg,
   unsubscribe request mistakenly sent to list posting addr)
 - Refine any remaining unqualified exception guards to specify target
   exceptions, when appropriate.
 - Turn standard mailman exceptions into class exceptions.
 - Implement cookies (with moderate lifetimes) for user and admin passwords.
 - Unravel edit-options functionality from cgi/subscribe script - give 
   edit-options a script of its own.  (Not imperative, maybe when the
   bigger project of implementing member profiles is done.)
 - Relax constraint that everything be installed in /home/mailman.
   (I'll probably do this for the next release.  We can probably use
   relative paths for most things, particularly the routine sys.path
   setting in all the python code, and possibly for the wrappers.)
 - Foolproof list deletion (bin/rmlist) a bit by asking for password
   (and have list admin or site password work).
 - Should member deletion be confirmed with email?
 - Submission of edited user options should return to edit-options
   page, like admin options pages do.
 - People mass subscribed on admin form should not require approval,
   even for closed-subscribe lists.
 - Implement a 'which' mailcmd.  (Probably not hard!  May be good intro
   project for someone wading into mailman development.)
 - Cascaded lists (lists that subscribe to other lists) should not
   have password notifications posted!
 - Include a recent verion of pipermail in the distribution (if warranted).

Some bigger Pending Projects:

 - Documentation:
   - Install (good start in README)
   - HOWTO setup a list
   - User and Admin Guides
     - Overview: features and finding your way around
     - Tasks
   - Developers guide
     - Architecture and API
     - Direct interaction (via interpreter) and script recipes
 - Encapsulate all modules within a python package, and use relative
   paths for everything else.
 - Email interface to admin commands.
 - Put the admin interface and other things like private subscriber rosters
   *behind* passwords, like the private archives are.  Eg, instead of
   putting the password box on the listinfo form, have it always be just
   a regular link to the roster, but then the roster page would be a
   password page if the roster is private and there's no cookie for it.
 - Catalogue mechanism - generalize and refine admindb so that pending bounces,
   subscriptions, etc are stored in the filesystem, nicely catalogued,
   and the interfaces for handling them (eg, admindb) shows succinct
   summaries, with links to see the entire things.  (I may work on
   this.)
 - (Scott Cotton doing/did this) Develop subscription mechanisms so real
   confirmation happens, and use that as basis for option to change
   existing subscription delivery address.  (Scott cotton is working
   on this.)
 - (Dragon doing/did this) Deliver by connect to SMTP 25 instead of
   sendmail.  (I'm checking in modules/smtplib.py module john's played
   with some.)
 - Robustify aliases handling to not just append entries if they
   already exist, and ideally, edit existing ones if they need to change.
 - (Scott doing/did this) Implement a real admin/membership-management
   section, that includes includes hidden subscribers, provides easy
   perusal and changing of all members (including concealed members)
   status, including disabling or removal from list.
 - Implement some automated validation of installation - check for
   obvious problems with options settings, file access permissions,
   sendmail hookup, etc.
 ? Have an implicit list-managers list for every site, which includes
   all the list managers?
 - Make listinfo page static, regenerated every time admin options are 
   changed.  This will speed up and reduce load for listinfo page
   loading.

More Fundamental, or just more bigger:), Pending Projects

 - Refine locking to only necessary sections, so there's less room for 
   unnecessary contention.
 - Implement the system as a persistent server.  (John's planning to
   do this.)
 - (Dragon's doing this) Implement member profiles, using a class.
   For name, organization, description, etc, and defaults options
   settings.  The lists, themselves, could still have copies of the
   specific passwords and the compact bitmaps (for the sake of
   efficiency) for list-specific options like digest/nondigest, but
   the user could set their default choices - delivery address,
   password, delivery mode - in their profile.

===================================================================

o Fix what new list mail has to say.
o Link from subscribe to options
o Edit posts from admindb page
o Make who, info, etc... take list as an optional argument.
o subject in caps
o headers on approve should die
o link to other lists, have a global page of lists on this server...
o ordering of post requests
o first time bounce on stale addr problem.
o link from subscribe page to options page
For the near future:
o Make these filter functions live together in self.
o Lower case all cmds in mailcmd
o Does admin password work for mail cmds?
o Occasionally remove stale bounce entries
o lower case all names?

o mkdigest command for cron, plus over the web button.
o Search engine for archives
o Month annotations?
o Logging -- remove all tmp logs.  
o Generic error template
o Go over code looking for dead functions / code (esp mm_html funcs)
o Mailman web pages / documentation
o The config program
o remove/fix valid_parent check in wrappers
o Catch common commands in mail...
o md5 checksums to prevent mail loops (how will this work?)
o For archives, perhaps switch to every n months?
o Receive Non-Mail Files
o If you don't crush by default, you get 2 subject lines...
o Clean up the code.

For the Mailman home page:
o What are digests?
o What does option XXX mean?
o How about removing a list?
o Document what tags you can use on each web page when editing html.
	-- Add links to the right pages.

The Config program:
o Remember to:
	-- trusted user the mailman (how about smail users?)
	-- Mail to mailman should go to server owner
	-- add Cw entries (smail users?)
o chmod o+x all these scripts in install.
o Hook up cron scripts as part of install. 
o Need to make sure that all paths used in code and the #! lines get updated
	  by the config process.
o Add mailman and mailman-owner users.
o Notification on subscribes / unsubscribes


####################################

Potential stuff for future versions:
o Configurable logging?
o Make it be a client-server thing, instead of reloading list info every time 
	some program wants to perform an operation on a list.
o Make the web page / list man stuff machine independant (Will require the
  client/server deal).
o Make the tag stuff accept arguments.
o New list -- prevent posting option
o precidence header
o Administrivia a la majordomo?
o Approval not over the web. (A by-mail interface to the admin stuff)
o Newsgroups gateway
o Global mailing list services:
	-- bit saying whether we've notified the main server.
	-- support for periodic confirmations.
	-- pass on stats.
