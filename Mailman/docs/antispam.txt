Anti-spam defences
==================

By design, Mailman does not have very sophisticated anti-spam measures because
this type of filtering is done much more efficiently at the MTA level.  For
example, if Mailman were to do spam detection, it could not reject the message
at SMTP time.

Still, Mailman does employ a small number of rather ham-handed anti-spam
measures.

    >>> from Mailman.Handlers.SpamDetect import process
    >>> from Mailman.Message import Message
    >>> from Mailman.queue import Switchboard
    >>> from Mailman.configuration import config
    >>> from Mailman.database import flush
    >>> from email import message_from_string
    >>> mlist = config.db.list_manager.create('_xtest@example.com')
    >>> flush()


Short circuiting
----------------

If a message is pre-approved, this handler does nothing.

    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: aperson@example.com
    ...
    ... An important message.
    ... """, Message)
    >>> msgdata = {'approved': True}
    >>> process(mlist, msg, msgdata)
    >>> print msg.as_string()
    From: aperson@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    An important message.
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> msgdata
    {'approved': True}


Header matching
---------------

There is a global configuration variable that can be set to a list of header
matches.  Each item in that list is a 2-tuple of the header to match and a
regular expression.  For example, if we wanted to block all message that come
from 'aperson' regardless of the domain, we'd do something like the following
in our mailman.cfg file:

    >>> config.KNOWN_SPAMMERS.append(('from', 'aperson'))

Now if the same message is posted to the mailing list, and that message is not
pre-approved.  The handler will throw an exception that signals the message is
spam.

    >>> msgdata = {}
    >>> process(mlist, msg, msgdata)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SpamDetected
    >>> print msg.as_string()
    From: aperson@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    An important message.
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> msgdata
    {}
