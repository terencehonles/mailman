Address registration
====================

When a user wants to join a mailing list -- any mailing list -- in the running
instance, he or she must first register with Mailman.  The only thing they
must supply is an email address, although there is additional information they
may supply.  All registered email addresses must be verified before Mailman
will send them any list traffic.

    >>> from Mailman.app.registrar import Registrar
    >>> from Mailman.configuration import config
    >>> from Mailman.interfaces import IRegistrar

The IUserManager manages users, but it does so at a fairly low level.
Specifically, it does not handle verifications, email address syntax validity
checks, etc.  The IRegistrar is the interface to the object handling all this
stuff.

Create a dummy domain, which will provide the context for the verification
email message.

    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> from Mailman.interfaces import IDomain
    >>> class TestDomain(object):
    ...     implements(IDomain)
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.domain_name = 'example.com'
    ...         self.description = 'mail.example.com'
    ...         self.contact_address = 'postmaster@mail.example.com'
    ...         self.base_url = 'http://mail.example.com'
    ...     def confirm_address(self, token=''):
    ...         return 'confirm+%s@example.com' % token
    ...     def confirm_url(self, token=''):
    ...         return self.base_url + '/confirm/' + token
    ...     def __conform__(self, protocol):
    ...         if protocol is IRegistrar:
    ...             return Registrar(self)
    ...         return None
    >>> domain = TestDomain()

Get a registrar by adapting a context to the interface.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> registrar = IRegistrar(domain)
    >>> verifyObject(IRegistrar, registrar)
    True

Here is a helper function to check the token strings.

    >>> def check_token(token):
    ...     assert isinstance(token, basestring), 'Not a string'
    ...     assert len(token) == 40, 'Unexpected length: %d' % len(token)
    ...     assert token.isalnum(), 'Not alphanumeric'
    ...     print 'ok'

Here is a helper function to extract tokens from confirmation messages.

    >>> import re
    >>> cre = re.compile('http://mail.example.com/confirm/(.*)')
    >>> def extract_token(msg):
    ...     mo = cre.search(qmsg.get_payload())
    ...     return mo.group(1)


Invalid email addresses
-----------------------

The only piece of information you need to register is the email address.
Some amount of sanity checks are performed on the email address, although
honestly, not as much as probably should be done.  Still, some patently bad
addresses are rejected outright.

    >>> registrar.register('')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: ''
    >>> registrar.register('some name@example.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: 'some name@example.com'
    >>> registrar.register('<script>@example.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: '<script>@example.com'
    >>> registrar.register('\xa0@example.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: '\xa0@example.com'
    >>> registrar.register('noatsign')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: 'noatsign'
    >>> registrar.register('nodom@ain')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidEmailAddress: 'nodom@ain'


Register an email address
-------------------------

Registration of an unknown address creates nothing until the confirmation step
is complete.  No IUser or IAddress is created at registration time, but a
record is added to the pending database, and the token for that record is
returned.

    >>> token = registrar.register(u'aperson@example.com', u'Anne Person')
    >>> check_token(token)
    ok

There should be no records in the user manager for this address yet.

    >>> usermgr = config.db.user_manager
    >>> print usermgr.get_user(u'aperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> print usermgr.get_address(u'aperson@example.com')
    None

But this address is waiting for confirmation.

    >>> pendingdb = config.db.pendings
    >>> sorted(pendingdb.confirm(token, expunge=False).items())
    [(u'address', u'aperson@example.com'),
     (u'real_name', u'Anne Person'),
     (u'type', u'registration')]


Verification by email
---------------------

There is also a verification email sitting in the virgin queue now.  This
message is sent to the user in order to verify the registered address.

    >>> from Mailman.queue import Switchboard
    >>> switchboard = Switchboard(config.VIRGINQUEUE_DIR)
    >>> len(switchboard.files)
    1
    >>> filebase = switchboard.files[0]
    >>> qmsg, qdata = switchboard.dequeue(filebase)
    >>> switchboard.finish(filebase)
    >>> print qmsg.as_string()
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: confirm ...
    From: confirm+...@example.com
    To: aperson@example.com
    Message-ID: <...>
    Date: ...
    Precedence: bulk
    <BLANKLINE>
    Email Address Registration Confirmation
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hello, this is the GNU Mailman server at example.com.
    <BLANKLINE>
    We have received a registration request for the email address
    <BLANKLINE>
        aperson@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    Before you can start using GNU Mailman at this site, you must first
    confirm that this is your email address.  You can do this by replying to
    this message, keeping the Subject header intact.  Or you can visit this
    web page
    <BLANKLINE>
        http://mail.example.com/confirm/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    If you do not wish to register this email address simply disregard this
    message.  If you think you are being maliciously subscribed to the list, or
    have any other questions, you may contact
    <BLANKLINE>
        postmaster@mail.example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> sorted(qdata.items())
    [('_parsemsg', False),
     ('nodecorate', True),
     ('received_time', ...),
     ('recips', [u'aperson@example.com']),
     ('reduced_list_headers', True),
     ('version', 3)]

The confirmation token shows up in several places, each of which provides an
easy way for the user to complete the confirmation.  The token will always
appear in a URL in the body of the message.

    >>> sent_token = extract_token(qmsg)
    >>> sent_token == token
    True

The same token will appear in the From header.

    >>> qmsg['from'] == 'confirm+' + token + '@example.com'
    True

It will also appear in the Subject header.

    >>> qmsg['subject'] == 'confirm ' + token
    True

The user would then validate their just registered address by clicking on a
url or responding to the message.  Either way, the confirmation process
extracts the token and uses that to confirm the pending registration.

    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True

Now, there is an IAddress in the database matching the address, as well as an
IUser linked to this address.  The IAddress is verified.

    >>> found_address = usermgr.get_address(u'aperson@example.com')
    >>> found_address
    <Address: Anne Person <aperson@example.com> [verified] at ...>
    >>> found_user = usermgr.get_user(u'aperson@example.com')
    >>> found_user
    <User "Anne Person" at ...>
    >>> found_user.controls(found_address.address)
    True
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> isinstance(found_address.verified_on, datetime)
    True


Non-standard registrations
--------------------------

If you try to confirm a registration token twice, of course only the first one
will work.  The second one is ignored.

    >>> token = registrar.register(u'bperson@example.com')
    >>> check_token(token)
    ok
    >>> filebase = switchboard.files[0]
    >>> qmsg, qdata = switchboard.dequeue(filebase)
    >>> switchboard.finish(filebase)
    >>> sent_token = extract_token(qmsg)
    >>> token == sent_token
    True
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    False

If an address is in the system, but that address is not linked to a user yet
and the address is not yet validated, then no user is created until the
confirmation step is completed.

    >>> usermgr.create_address(u'cperson@example.com')
    <Address: cperson@example.com [not verified] at ...>
    >>> token = registrar.register(u'cperson@example.com', u'Claire Person')
    >>> print usermgr.get_user(u'cperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> filebase = switchboard.files[0]
    >>> qmsg, qdata = switchboard.dequeue(filebase)
    >>> switchboard.finish(filebase)
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True
    >>> usermgr.get_user(u'cperson@example.com')
    <User "Claire Person" at ...>
    >>> usermgr.get_address(u'cperson@example.com')
    <Address: cperson@example.com [verified] at ...>

If an address being registered has already been verified, linked or not to a
user, then registration sends no confirmation.

    >>> print registrar.register(u'cperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> len(switchboard.files)
    0

But if the already verified address is not linked to a user, then a user is
created now and they are linked, with no confirmation necessary.

    >>> address = usermgr.create_address(u'dperson@example.com', u'Dave Person')
    >>> address.verified_on = datetime.now()
    >>> print usermgr.get_user(u'dperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> print registrar.register(u'dperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> len(switchboard.files)
    0
    >>> usermgr.get_user(u'dperson@example.com')
    <User "Dave Person" at ...>


Discarding
----------

A confirmation token can also be discarded, say if the user changes his or her
mind about registering.  When discarded, no IAddress or IUser is created.

    >>> token = registrar.register(u'eperson@example.com', u'Elly Person')
    >>> check_token(token)
    ok
    >>> registrar.discard(token)
    >>> print pendingdb.confirm(token)
    None
    >>> print usermgr.get_address(u'eperson@example.com')
    None
    >>> print usermgr.get_user(u'eperson@example.com')
    None


Registering a new address for an existing user
----------------------------------------------

When a new address for an existing user is registered, there isn't too much
different except that the new address will still need to be verified before it
can be used.

    >>> dperson = usermgr.get_user(u'dperson@example.com')
    >>> dperson
    <User "Dave Person" at ...>
    >>> from operator import attrgetter
    >>> sorted((addr for addr in dperson.addresses), key=attrgetter('address'))
    [<Address: Dave Person <dperson@example.com> [verified] at ...>]
    >>> dperson.register(u'david.person@example.com', u'David Person')
    <Address: David Person <david.person@example.com> [not verified] at ...>
    >>> token = registrar.register(u'david.person@example.com')
    >>> filebase = switchboard.files[0]
    >>> qmsg, qdata = switchboard.dequeue(filebase)
    >>> switchboard.finish(filebase)
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True
    >>> user = usermgr.get_user(u'david.person@example.com')
    >>> user is dperson
    True
    >>> user
    <User "Dave Person" at ...>
    >>> sorted((addr for addr in user.addresses), key=attrgetter('address'))
    [<Address: David Person <david.person@example.com> [verified] at ...>,
     <Address: Dave Person <dperson@example.com> [verified] at ...>]


Corner cases
------------

If you try to confirm a token that doesn't exist in the pending database, the
confirm method will just return None.

    >>> registrar.confirm('no token')
    False

Likewise, if you try to confirm, through the IUserRegistrar interface, a token
that doesn't match a registration even, you will get None.  However, the
pending even matched with that token will still be removed.

    >>> from Mailman.interfaces import IPendable
    >>> class SimplePendable(dict):
    ...     implements(IPendable)
    >>> pendable = SimplePendable(type='foo', bar='baz')
    >>> token = pendingdb.add(pendable)
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    False
    >>> print pendingdb.confirm(token)
    None

If somehow the pending registration event doesn't have an address in its
record, you will also get None back, and the record will be removed.

    >>> pendable = SimplePendable(type='registration', foo='bar')
    >>> token = pendingdb.add(pendable)
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    False
    >>> print pendingdb.confirm(token)
    None
