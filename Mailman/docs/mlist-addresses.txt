Mailing list addresses
======================

Every mailing list has a number of addresses which are publicly available.
These are defined in the IMailingListAddresses interface.

    >>> from Mailman.configuration import config
    >>> mlist = config.db.list_manager.create(u'_xtest@example.com')

The posting address is where people send messages to be posted to the mailing
list.  This is exactly the same as the fully qualified list name.

    >>> mlist.fqdn_listname
    u'_xtest@example.com'
    >>> mlist.posting_address
    u'_xtest@example.com'

Messages to the mailing list's 'no reply' address always get discarded without
prejudice.

    >>> mlist.noreply_address
    u'noreply@example.com'

The mailing list's owner address reaches the human moderators.

    >>> mlist.owner_address
    u'_xtest-owner@example.com'

The request address goes to the list's email command robot.

    >>> mlist.request_address
    u'_xtest-request@example.com'

The bounces address accepts and processes all potential bounces.

    >>> mlist.bounces_address
    u'_xtest-bounces@example.com'

The join (a.k.a. subscribe) address is where someone can email to get added to
the mailing list.  The subscribe alias is a synonym for join, but it's
deprecated.

    >>> mlist.join_address
    u'_xtest-join@example.com'
    >>> mlist.subscribe_address
    u'_xtest-subscribe@example.com'

The leave (a.k.a. unsubscribe) address is where someone can email to get added
to the mailing list.  The unsubscribe alias is a synonym for leave, but it's
deprecated.

    >>> mlist.leave_address
    u'_xtest-leave@example.com'
    >>> mlist.unsubscribe_address
    u'_xtest-unsubscribe@example.com'


Email confirmations
-------------------

Email confirmation messages are sent when actions such as subscriptions need
to be confirmed.  It requires that a cookie be provided, which will be
included in the local part of the email address.  The exact format of this is
dependent on the VERP_CONFIRM_FORMAT configuration variable.

    >>> mlist.confirm_address('cookie')
    u'_xtest-confirm+cookie@example.com'
    >>> mlist.confirm_address('wookie')
    u'_xtest-confirm+wookie@example.com'

    >>> old_format = config.VERP_CONFIRM_FORMAT
    >>> config.VERP_CONFIRM_FORMAT = '$address---$cookie'
    >>> mlist.confirm_address('cookie')
    u'_xtest-confirm---cookie@example.com'
    >>> config.VERP_CONFIRM_FORMAT = old_format
