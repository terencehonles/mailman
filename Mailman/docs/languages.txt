Languages
=========

Mailman is multilingual.  A language manager handles the known set of
languages at run time, as well as enabling those languages for use in a
running Mailman instance.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from Mailman.interfaces import ILanguageManager
    >>> from Mailman.languages import LanguageManager
    >>> mgr = LanguageManager()
    >>> verifyObject(ILanguageManager, mgr)
    True

A language manager keeps track of the languages it knows about as well as the
languages which are enabled.  By default, none are known or enabled.

    >>> sorted(mgr.known_codes)
    []
    >>> sorted(mgr.enabled_codes)
    []
    
The language manager also keeps track of information for each known language,
but you obviously can't get information for an unknown language.

    >>> mgr.get_language_data('en')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    KeyError: 'en'


Adding languages
----------------

Adding a new language requires three pieces of information, the 2-character
language code, the English description of the language, and the character set
used by the language.

    >>> mgr.add_language('en', 'English', 'us-ascii')
    >>> mgr.add_language('it', 'Italian', 'iso-8859-1')

By default, added languages are also enabled.

    >>> sorted(mgr.known_codes)
    ['en', 'it']
    >>> sorted(mgr.enabled_codes)
    ['en', 'it']

And you can get information for all known languages.

    >>> mgr.get_language_data('en')
    ('English', 'us-ascii')
    >>> mgr.get_language_data('it')
    ('Italian', 'iso-8859-1')

You can also add a language without enabling it.

    >>> mgr.add_language('pl', 'Polish', 'iso-8859-2', enable=False)
    >>> sorted(mgr.known_codes)
    ['en', 'it', 'pl']
    >>> sorted(mgr.enabled_codes)
    ['en', 'it']

You can get language data for disabled languages.

    >>> mgr.get_language_data('pl')
    ('Polish', 'iso-8859-2')

And of course you can enable a known language.

    >>> mgr.enable_language('pl')
    >>> sorted(mgr.enabled_codes)
    ['en', 'it', 'pl']

But you cannot enable languages that the manager does not know about.

    >>> mgr.enable_language('xx')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    KeyError: 'xx'


Other iterations
----------------

You can iterate over the descriptions (names) of all enabled languages.

    >>> sorted(mgr.enabled_names)
    ['English', 'Italian', 'Polish']

You can ask whether a particular language code is enabled.

    >>> 'it' in mgr.enabled_codes
    True
