# no envelope sender.  Set this variable to 0 to always use the sender.
#
# The envelope sender is set by the SMTP delivery and is thus less easily
# spoofed than the sender, which is typically just taken from the From: header 
# and thus easily spoofed by the end-user.  However, sometimes the envelope
# sender isn't set correctly and this will manifest itself by postings being
