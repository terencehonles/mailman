Known bugs:

- There seems to be a problem building the C wrappers on FreeBSD
  systems when not using GNU make (gmake).  The symptom is that you
  get an undefined symbol `_main' in /usr/lib/crt0.o.  We don't know
  anything more about the causes, and there is some suspicion that the 
  problem is unrelated to Mailman.  Using gmake to build Mailman
  appears to solve the problem.
