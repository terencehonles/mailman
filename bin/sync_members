"""Synchronize a mailing list's membership with a flat file.

This script is useful if you have a Mailman mailing list and a sendmail
:include: style list of addresses (also as is used in Majordomo).  For every
address in the file that does not appear in the mailing list, the address is
added.  For every address in the mailing list that does not appear in the
file, the address is removed.  Other options control what happens when an
address is added or removed.

Usage: %(program)s [options] -f file listname

Where `options' are:

    --no-change
    -n
        Don't actually make the changes.  Instead, print out what would be
        done to the list.

    --welcome-msg[=<yes|no>]
    -w[=<yes|no>]
        Sets whether or not to send the newly added members a welcome
        message, overriding whatever the list's `send_welcome_msg' setting
        is.  With -w=yes or -w, the welcome message is sent.  With -w=no, no
        message is sent.

    --digest[=<yes|no>]
    -d[=<yes|no>]
        Selects whether to make newly added members receive messages in
        digests.  With -d=yes or -d, they become digest members.  With -d=no
        (or if no -d option given) they are added as regular members.

    --notifyadmin[=<yes|no>]
    --a[=<yes|no>]
        Specifies whether the admin should be notified for each subscription
        or unsubscription.  If you're adding a lot of addresses, you
        definitely want to turn this off!  With -a=yes or -a, the admin is
        notified.  With -a=no, the admin is not notified.  With no -a option,
        the default for the list is used.

    --file <filename | ->
    -f <filename | ->
        This option is required.  It specifies the flat file to synchronize
        against.  Email addresses must appear one per line.  If filename is
        `-' then stdin is used.

    --help
    -h
        Print this message.

    listname
        Required.  This specifies the list to synchronize.
