"""Rebuild a list's archive.

Use this command to rebuild the archives for a mailing list.  You may want to
do this if you edit some messages in an archive, or remove some messages from
an archive.

Usage: %(program)s <listname> [<mbox>] [-h]

Where <mbox> is the path to a list's complete mbox archive.  Usually this will 
be some path in the archives/private directory.  For example:

%% bin/arch mylist archives/private/mylist.mbox/mylist.mbox

<mbox> is optional.  If it is missing, it is calculated.
