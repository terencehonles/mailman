"""List all the members of a mailing list.

Usage: %(program)s [-o file] [-r] [-d] [-p] [-h] listname

Where:

    --output file
    -o file
        Write output to specified file instead of standard out.

    --regular
    -r
        Print just the regular (non-digest) members.

    --digest
    -d
        Print just the digest members.

    --preserve
    -p
        Output member addresses case preserved the way they were added to the
        list.  Otherwise, addresses are printed in all lowercase.

    --help
    -h
        Print this help message and exit.

    listname is the name of the mailing list to use.

Note that if neither -r or -d is supplied, both regular members are printed
first, followed by digest members, but no indication is given as to address
status.
