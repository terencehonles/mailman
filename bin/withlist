"""Start interacting with a mailing list.

This is useful for playing with a list from Python's interactive interpreter.
Run this script as follows:

%% python -i bin/withlist [options] listname

This will load the list object named by <listname> into an object called `m'
in the global namespace.  It also loads the class MailList into the global
namespace.

Options:

    -l
    --lock
        Lock the list when opening.  Normally the list is opened unlocked
        (e.g. for read-only operations).  You can always lock the file after
        the fact by typing `m.Lock()'

        Note that if you use this option, you should explicitly call
        m.Unlock() before exiting, since the interpreter's clean up procedure
        will not cause the lock to be deleted automatically.

    --run [module.]callable
    -r [module.]callable
        This can be used to run a script with the opened MailList object.
        This works by attempting to import `module' (which must already be
        accessible on your sys.path), and then calling `callable' from the
        module.  callable can be a class or function; it is called with a
        single argument, the MailList object.

        Note that `module.' is optional; if it is omitted then a module with
        the name `callable' will be imported.

        The global variable `r' will be set to the results of this call.

        See below for an example.

    --help
    -h
        Print this message and exit

Here's an example of how to use the -r option.  Say you have a file in the
Mailman installation directory called `listaddr.py', with the following
two functions:

def listaddr(mlist):
    print mlist.GetListEmail()

def requestaddr(mlist):
    print mlist.GetRequestEmail()

Now, from the command line you can print the list's posting address by running
the following from the command line:

%% python bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist
Loading list: mylist (unlocked)
Importing listaddr ...
Running listaddr.listaddr() ...
mylist@myhost.com

And you can print the list's request address by running:

%% python bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist
Loading list: mylist (unlocked)
Importing listaddr ...
Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...
mylist-request@myhost.com
