"""Primary start-up and shutdown script for Mailman's qrunner daemon.

This script starts, stops, and restarts the main Mailman queue runners, making
sure that the various long-running sub-qrunners are still alive and kicking.
It does this by forking and exec'ing the sub-qrunners and waiting on their
pids.  When it detects a subprocess has exited, it may restart it.

The sub-qrunners respond to SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP.  SIGINT and SIGTERM
both cause the sub-qrunners to exit cleanly, but the master will only restart
sub-qrunners that have exited due to a SIGINT.  SIGHUP causes the master
qrunner and sub-qrunners to close their log files, and reopen then upon the
next printed message.

The master qrunner also responds to SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP, which it
simply passes on to the sub-qrunners (note that the master will close and
reopen its own log files on receipt of a SIGHUP).  The master qrunner also
leaves its own process id in the file data/master-qrunner.pid but you normally
don't need to use this pid directly.  The `start', `stop', `restart', and
`open' commands handle everything for you.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] [ start | stop | restart | reopen ]

Options:

    -n/--no-restart
        Don't restart the sub-qrunners when they exit because of an error or a
        SIGINT (they are never restarted if they exit in response to a
        SIGTERM).  Use this only for debugging.  Only useful if the `start'
        command is given.

    -u/--run-as-user
        Normally, this script will refuse to run if the user id and group id
        are not set to the `mailman' user and group (as defined when you
        configured Mailman).  If run as root, this script will change to this
        user and group before the check is made.

        This can be inconvenient for testing and debugging purposes, so the -u
        flag means that the step that sets and checks the uid/gid is skipped,
        and the program is run as the current user and group.  This flag is
        not recommended for normal production environments.

    -s/--stale-lock-cleanup
        If mailmanctl finds an existing master qrunner lock, it will normally
        exit with an error message.  With this optionn, mailmanctl will perform
        an extra level of checking.  If a process matching the host/pid
        described in the lock file is running, mailmanctl will still exit, but
        if no matching process is found, mailmanctl will remove the apparently
        stale lock and make another attempt to claim the master lock.

    -q/--quiet
        Don't print status messages.  Error messages are still printed to
        standard error.

    -h/--help
        Print this message and exit.

Commands:

    start   - Start the master qrunner daemon and all sub-qrunners.  Prints a
              message and exits if the master qrunner daemon is already
              running.

    stop    - Stops the master qrunner daemon and all sub-qrunners.  After
              stopping, no more messages will be processed.

    restart - Restarts the sub-qrunners, but not the master qrunner.  This is
              really handy for development because the without restarting, the
              sub-qrunners won't reload any changed modules.

    reopen  - This will simply cause all log files to be re-opened.
