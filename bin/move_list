"""Move a list to a new directory.

What this really does is just update the three archive list attributes
public_archive_file_dir, private_archive_file_dir, and archive_directory by
recalculating them based on the new Defaults.  It then saves the list.

Usage:
    move_list [options] listname

Options:
    --help
    -h
        Print this help message and exit.

listname must be a valid mailing list name and is required.
