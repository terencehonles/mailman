"""Poll the NNTP servers for messages to be gatewayed to mailing lists.

Usage is either

    gate_news

or

    gate_news listname first last

In the former case, the watermark file is used to find the first message to
post, and all messages up to the last available on the newsgroup are gated.
The watermark file is then updated for the next run.  This is the way the
script should be run from cron.

In the latter case, only the specified mailing list's newsgroup is polled, and
only the message from first to last (inclusive) are gated to the mailing
list.  In this case, the watermark file is /not/ updated.

Either form can be run from the command line.
