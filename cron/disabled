"""Process disabled members, recommended once per day.

This script cruises through every mailing list looking for members whose
delivery is disabled.  If they have been disabled due to bounces, they will
receive another notification, or they may be removed if they've received the
maximum number of notifications.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options]

Options:
    -h / --help
        Print this message and exit.

    -l listname
    --list listname
        Process only the given list, otherwise do all lists.
