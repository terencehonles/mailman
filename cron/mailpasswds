"""Send password reminders for all lists to all users.

Any arguments are taken as a list of addresses that become the focus - only
the subscribers on the list are attended to, all other subscribers are
ignored.  In addition, if any addresses are specified, a line is printed for
each list where that address is found.  (Otherwise operation is silent.)

We accumulate users and their passwords, and use the last list to send a
single message to each user with their complete collection of passwords,
rather than sending a single message for each password.

If mm_cfg.VIRTUAL_HOST_OVERVIEW is true, we further group users by the virtual
host the mailing lists are assigned to.  This is so that virtual domains are
treated like real separate machines.
