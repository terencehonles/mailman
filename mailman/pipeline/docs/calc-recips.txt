Calculating recipients
======================

Every message that makes it through to the list membership gets sent to a set
of recipient addresses.  These addresses are calculated by one of the handler
modules and depends on a host of factors.

    >>> handler = config.handlers['calculate-recipients']
    >>> mlist = config.db.list_manager.create(u'_xtest@example.com')

Recipients are calculate from the list members, so add a bunch of members to
start out with.  First, create a bunch of addresses...

    >>> usermgr = config.db.user_manager
    >>> address_a = usermgr.create_address(u'aperson@example.com')
    >>> address_b = usermgr.create_address(u'bperson@example.com')
    >>> address_c = usermgr.create_address(u'cperson@example.com')
    >>> address_d = usermgr.create_address(u'dperson@example.com')
    >>> address_e = usermgr.create_address(u'eperson@example.com')
    >>> address_f = usermgr.create_address(u'fperson@example.com')

...then subscribe these addresses to the mailing list as members...

    >>> from mailman.interfaces import MemberRole
    >>> member_a = address_a.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)
    >>> member_b = address_b.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)
    >>> member_c = address_c.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)
    >>> member_d = address_d.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)
    >>> member_e = address_e.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)
    >>> member_f = address_f.subscribe(mlist, MemberRole.member)

...then make some of the members digest members.

    >>> from mailman.constants import DeliveryMode
    >>> member_d.preferences.delivery_mode = DeliveryMode.plaintext_digests
    >>> member_e.preferences.delivery_mode = DeliveryMode.mime_digests
    >>> member_f.preferences.delivery_mode = DeliveryMode.summary_digests


Short-circuiting
----------------

Sometimes, the list of recipients already exists in the message metadata.
This can happen for example, when a message was previously delivered to some
but not all of the recipients.

    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: Xavier Person <xperson@example.com>
    ...
    ... Something of great import.
    ... """)
    >>> recips = set((u'qperson@example.com', u'zperson@example.com'))
    >>> msgdata = dict(recips=recips)
    >>> handler.process(mlist, msg, msgdata)
    >>> sorted(msgdata['recips'])
    [u'qperson@example.com', u'zperson@example.com']


Regular delivery recipients
---------------------------

Regular delivery recipients are those people who get messages from the list as
soon as they are posted.  In other words, these folks are not digest members.

    >>> msgdata = {}
    >>> handler.process(mlist, msg, msgdata)
    >>> sorted(msgdata['recips'])
    [u'aperson@example.com', u'bperson@example.com', u'cperson@example.com']

Members can elect not to receive a list copy of their own postings.

    >>> member_c.preferences.receive_own_postings = False
    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: Claire Person <cperson@example.com>
    ...
    ... Something of great import.
    ... """)
    >>> msgdata = {}
    >>> handler.process(mlist, msg, msgdata)
    >>> sorted(msgdata['recips'])
    [u'aperson@example.com', u'bperson@example.com']

Members can also elect not to receive a list copy of any message on which they
are explicitly named as a recipient.  However, see the AvoidDuplicates handler
for details.
