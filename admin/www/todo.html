<h3> The Mailman Wishlist
</h3>
 Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1 (still in alpha as of this
 writing 11-Jul-2001), so what's left will probably end up in a
 Mailman 3.0.
 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage

<h3> Email Handling
</h3>

 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage

    <li> Use VERP or DSN for address tracing, perhaps tied to the monthly password reminders, or VERPing the occasional regular message.

    <li> Re-implement bulk mailer the Right Way: an asynchat/asyncore server to do DNS lookups and remote MTA delivery directly
 (optional).

</ul>
<h3> Documentation

    <li> A detailed feature list
    <li> A user's guide
    <li> A site-admin's guide
    <li> A list-admin's guide
    <li> More on-line documentation and UI help
    <li> A developer's guide w/ architecture and API information
    <li> manpages for the scripts in bin and cron
    <li> Integrate Christopher Kolar's documentation

 a template language/system like Zope's Presentation Templates,
 Quixote, or PHP.

    <li> Default UI should add a navigation sidebar to all web pages.

    <li> Allow the list-admin to require approvals for unsubs
    <li> Allow the admin to disable option settings by users
    <li> Ability to set defaults for the various user settings from the "Membership Management" page.

    <li> Allow admins to control and set individual headers, adding, removing, or overriding those in the original message (sometimes
 very useful, but could be dangerous!)

    <li> New moderation choice: archive but don't send to list.
    <li> New moderation choice: annotate and send to author for resubmittal.
    <li> Make it easier for an admin who manages multiple lists to handling pending requests sitting on all those lists.

    <li> Ability to ban specific troublesome users (from posting, subscribing, etc).  Posts from banned users would be discarded.

    <li> Better integration with moderated newsgroups (and allow some addresses to bypass even that moderation and be delivered to a
 secondary channel, like moderators@isc.org).

    <li> Add an option to include Reply-To: header in the membership test for a members-only list posting

    <li> Allow the user to be excluded from postings if they're getting them in the to: or cc: headers.  Be smarter about filtering out
 duplicate deliveries.

    <li> Have one account per user per site, with multiple email addresses and fallbacks.  Allow them to subscribe whichever
 address they want to whichever list, with different options per
 subscription.

    <li> Allow the user to get BOTH normal and digested delivery (but I still don't understand why someone would want this)

    <li> More flexible digests: index digests (subject and authors only, with URLs to retrieve the article)

    <li> Timed vacations, allowing a user to postpone or discard email for a certain number of days or weeks.

 this.  Also, adding a confirmation with click-thru confirmation
 to resubscribe.

    <li> For email subscribes, keep an audit of where requests are coming from, and send the original request headers in the confirmation
 message.  Helps track down subscribe bombs.

    <li> Use VERP or DSN for address tracing, perhaps tied to the monthly password reminders, or VERPing the occasional regular message.

    <li> Re-implement bulk mailer the Right Way: an asynchat/asyncore server to do DNS lookups and remote MTA delivery directly
 (optional).

    <li> A detailed feature list
    <li> A user's guide
    <li> A site-admin's guide
    <li> A list-admin's guide
    <li> More on-line documentation and UI help
    <li> A developer's guide w/ architecture and API information
    <li> manpages for the scripts in bin and cron
    <li> Integrate Christopher Kolar's documentation
    <li> NO DEAD ENDS and every web page is reachable.
    <li> All web UI must be configurable so that it more easily integrates into an existing site's design.  Probably means using
 a template language/system like Zope's Presentation Templates,
 Quixote, or PHP.

    <li> Default UI should add a navigation sidebar to all web pages.
    <li> Web pages should never mention disabled features.
    <li> Allow the moderator to edit posts being held for approval (make it evident, either through a header or other means that the
 message was edited by the moderator).

    <li> Allow the list-admin to require approvals for unsubs
    <li> Allow the admin to disable option settings by users
    <li> Ability to set defaults for the various user settings from the "Membership Management" page.

    <li> Allow admins to control and set individual headers, adding, removing, or overriding those in the original message (sometimes
 very useful, but could be dangerous!)

    <li> New moderation choice: archive but don't send to list.
    <li> New moderation choice: annotate and send to author for resubmittal.
    <li> Make it easier for an admin who manages multiple lists to handling pending requests sitting on all those lists.

    <li> Ability to ban specific troublesome users (from posting, subscribing, etc).  Posts from banned users would be discarded.

    <li> Better integration with moderated newsgroups (and allow some addresses to bypass even that moderation and be delivered to a
 secondary channel, like moderators@isc.org).

    <li> Add an option to include Reply-To: header in the membership test for a members-only list posting

    <li> Allow the user to be excluded from postings if they're getting them in the to: or cc: headers.  Be smarter about filtering out
 duplicate deliveries.

    <li> Have one account per user per site, with multiple email addresses and fallbacks.  Allow them to subscribe whichever
 address they want to whichever list, with different options per
 subscription.

    <li> Allow the user to get BOTH normal and digested delivery (but I still don't understand why someone would want this)

    <li> More flexible digests: index digests (subject and authors only, with URLs to retrieve the article)

    <li> Timed vacations, allowing a user to postpone or discard email for a certain number of days or weeks.

    <li> Allow the site admin to define list styles or themes, and list admins to choose one of the canned styles to apply to their
 list.

    <li> A better strategy is needed for sub-lists and super-lists, including dealing with the resulting password reminders and
 authorization to modify the sub & superlists.  Majordomo2 is
 reported to have some good features in this regard.

    <li> Add a limit on the number of posts from any one individual within a period of time (1 post per day, 10 per week, etc).

    <li> Don't use the first public mailing list as the `originator' of password reminders.

    <li> Provide an email interface to all administrative commands
    <li> Allow email unsubs from matching address to unsubscribe, possibly adding an "allow open unsubscribes" option to control
 this.  Also, adding a confirmation with click-thru confirmation
 to resubscribe.

    <li> For email subscribes, keep an audit of where requests are coming from, and send the original request headers in the confirmation
 message.  Helps track down subscribe bombs.

    <li> Investigate Majordomo2's email admin capabilities.
    <li> Support the `which' command.
    <li> Use a real transactional database for all information, and allow various bits of information to come from different sources (a
 relational database, ZODB, LDAP, etc)

    <li> Member profiles
    <li> Do a serious and thorough security audit (ongoing)
    <li> Allow lists of the same name in two different virtual domains
    <li> More sophisticated attachment handling: strip and discard attachments, post attachments (e.g. via WebDAV) and rewrite to
 include URLs, etc.  Should be admin configurable based on MIME
 type.  Check out Bill Bumgarner's work on this.

    <li> Should be able to gather statistics, such as deliveries/day, performance, number of subscribers over time, etc.

    <li> Implement something like Roundup's nosy lists, maybe even integrate with Roundup.

    <li> Split Mailman into libraries so, e.g. the delivery part could be used by other projects.

</ul>
<h3> Bounce handling
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>  Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1 (still in alpha as of this
 writing 11-Jul-2001), so what's left will probably end up in a
 Mailman 3.0.

    <li> Reminders to disabled addresses.  The idea is that if an addr is disabled due to bouncing, we should send out periodic reminders.
