</td>

<tr>
<td>
Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a web page, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the web.  Mailman also integrates most things
people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail <->
news gateways, and so on. See the <a href=features.html>features
page</a> for a brief overview of features.<p>

Mailman has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.<p> Mailman
is free software.  As of our next release, Mailman will be released
under the GNU GPL.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
Before you can run Mailman, you need to download and install the <a href=http://www.python.org/>Python programming language (version 1.5 or later)</a>.<p>
The first GNU release is not out yet.  For now, you can get the last
pre-GNU beta release (1.0b4) <A
HREF=ftp://list.org/pub/mailman/>here</a>.
The next release will be in early June.
