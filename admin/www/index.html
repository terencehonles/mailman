Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a web page, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the web.  Mailman also integrates most things
people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving,
mail-to-news
gateways, and so on. See the 
<a href="features.html">features page</a>
for a brief overview of features.

<p>Mailman has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.

<p>Mailman is free software.  It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.  The canonical Mailman home page is at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html">
www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html</a>, with more information
available at <a href="http://www.list.org/">www.list.org</a>.

<p>Mailman is brought to you by the <em>Mailman Cabal</em>, currently
composed of the following core developers: Barry Warsaw, Harald
Meland, Ken Manheimer, Scott Cotton, and John Viega.  Mailman was
originally written by John Viega.

<p>The Cabal would like to thank the following other developers for
their important contributions (in no particular order): Juan Carlos
Rey Anaya, Victoriano Giralt, Mads Kiilerich, The Dragon De Monsyne,
Timothy O'Malley, Balazs Nagy, Michael Mclay, Greg Stein, Gergely
Madarasz, Andrew Kuchling, Jeff Hahn, Paul Hebble, Christopher
P. Lindsey, Chris Kolar, J C Lawrence, Jeremy Hylton, Nigel
Metheringham, Dan Mick, Jim Tittsler, Ricardo Kustner, Bernhard
Reiter, Thomas Wouters, Jeff Berliner, Ted Cabeen, Michael Yount, Ron
Jarrell, Chris Snell, David Champion, Darrell Fuhriman, Owen Taylor.
<b>We have a extensive wish list and welcome anyone else who would
like to contribute!</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

Before you can run Mailman, you need to download and install the
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python
programming language</a>.  You need at least Python 1.5.2, but Mailman
also works fine with Python 1.6 and
<a href="http://www.pythonlabs.com/products/python2.0/">Python 2.0</a>.

<p>Version
(<!-VERSION--->2.0rc1<!-VERSION--->,
released on
<!-DATE--->Oct 23 2000<!-DATE--->)
is the current GNU release.  It is available
<A HREF="mailman.tar.gz">here</a>.

<p>A number of papers and other material presented at
<a href="http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings.html">
the 7th International Python Conference</a> and the 12th Usenix LISA
conference are available <a href="mailman-docs.tar.gz">here</a>.

<a href="http://www.aurora.edu/~ckolar">Chris Kolar</a> has made
available <a href="http://www.aurora.edu/~ckolar/mailman/">Mailman
documentation</a>, primarily for list owners who are not necessarily
technical, but who own Mailman mailing lists.

<p>The <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> is
available to answer most questions.  For issues not covered in the
FAQ, please post your questions to the
<a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users">
Mailman-Users</a>
mailing list.  You might also want to check out the
<a href="http://www.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/">
Mailman Users mailing list archive</a> to see if your problem has
already been addressed.

<p>Mailman is being developed on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mailman">SourceForge</a>.
Please use the SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=103">bug tracker</a> to
report any bugs; I've retired the old Jitterbug database on
python.org.  If you have patches you'd like to submit, the best place
to do that is on the SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=103">patch manager</a>.

<p>Nigel Metheringham has posted a
<a href="http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman.html">HOWTO on using Exim
and Mailman</a> together.  If you're using the
<a href="http://www.exim.org">Exim MTA</a> you should check this out.

We have several mailing lists devoted to Mailman, which also provide a 
nice demonstration of Mailman!

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-announce">
    Mailman Announce</a> is a read-only list that you can subscribe to 
    if you are only interested in release notices and other important
    news.  Only the core Mailman developers can post messages to this
    list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users">
    Mailman Users</a> is the mailing list to subscribe to if you are
    using Mailman at your site, and may have problems or questions
    relating to installation, use, etc.  We'll try to keep the deep
    technical discussions off this list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers">
    Mailman Developers</a> is the mailing list to use if you are
    interested in helping us develop Mailman, discuss future
    directions, etc.  This is the list for more in-depth technical
    issues.

    <p>You may also want to find a project on our Mailman
    <a href="todo.html">TODO list</a>.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-i18n">
    Mailman Internationalization</a> is the list for discussing the
    multi-lingual extensions to Mailman, which will likely be folded
    into the standard distribution after the 2.0 release.  Once
    integrated, this list will be a way for language translators to
    submit new translation files.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-checkins">
    Mailman Checkins</a> is an adjunct list to the publically
    accessible read-only CVS repository.  This list is for the
    hardcore developers, or anybody else submitting patches, since we
    really prefer such patches to be generated against the latest
    snapshot.  This is a read-only list; only the core Mailman
    developers can post messages to this list.  There is no archive.

</ul>

Mailman was featured in a
<a href="http://www.sunworld.com/swol-03-1999/swol-03-mailtools.html">
cover story article</a> in the March 1999 issue
of SunWorld.  The article was written by Cameron Laird and Kathryn
Soraiz.

<p>Mailman was briefly mentioned in
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/sr/stories/issue/0,4537,387506,00.html">
a ZDNet article</a> on Linux.  This was picked up by
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/244979.asp">MSNBC</a> (I won't
comment on the irony there).
