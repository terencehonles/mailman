  <li>Most standard mailing list features, including list moderation,
    mail based commands, digests (both MIME and `plain'), and so on.

  <p><li>An extensive web-based user interface that is customizable on a
    per-list basis.  This allows users to manage their own
    subscriptions, with support for temporarily disabling their
    accounts, selecting digest modes, hiding their email addresses
    from other members, etc.

  <p><li>A web-based list administration interface for <b>all</b>
    admin-type tasks, including list configuration, moderation (post
    approvals), selection of posting and subscribing rules, management
    of user accounts via the web, etc.

  <p><li>Automatic web-based hypermail-style archiving, including
    provisions for private archives.
  
  <p><li>Integrated gatewaying to and from Usenet.

  <p><li>Smart bounce detection with automatic disposition
    (i.e. configurable disabling, unsubscribing).

  <p><li>Direct SMTP delivery of messages, including integrated fast
    bulk mailing.

  <p><li>Smart spam protection.

  <p><li>Multiple list owners and moderators are possible.
  
  <p><li>Optional (per-user) MIME-compliant digests.

  <p><li>Support for virtual domains.

  <p><li>Runs on most Un*x-like systems, compatible with most web
    servers and browsers, and most SMTP servers.  Compatible with
    Python 1.5 or newer.  Mailman does not currently work on Windows.
