Mailing lists
=============

The REST API can be queried for the set of known mailing lists.  There is a
top level collection that can return all the mailing lists.  There aren't any
yet though.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/lists')
    resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#mailing_lists
    start: None
    total_size: 0
