MTA connections
===============

Outgoing connections to the outgoing mail transport agent (MTA) are mitigated
through a Connection class, which can transparently manage multiple sessions
to a single physical MTA.

    >>> from mailman.mta.connection import Connection

The number of connections per session is specified when the Connection object
is created, as is the host and port number of the SMTP server.

    >>> connection = Connection(
    ...     config.mta.smtp_host, int(config.mta.smtp_port), 1)
    
At the start, there have been no connections to the server.

    >>> smtpd.get_session_count()
    0
