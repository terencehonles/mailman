==================
The 'join' command
==================

The mail command 'join' subscribes an email address to the mailing list.
'subscribe' is an alias for 'join'.

    >>> command = config.commands['join']
    >>> print command.name
    join
    >>> print command.description
    Join this mailing list.  You will be asked to confirm your subscription
    request and you may be issued a provisional password.
    <BLANKLINE>
    By using the 'digest' option, you can specify whether you want digest
    delivery or not.  If not specified, the mailing list's default will be
    used.  You can also subscribe an alternative address by using the
    'address' option.  For example:
    <BLANKLINE>
        join address=myotheraddress@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> print command.argument_description
    [digest=<yes|no>] [address=<address>]


No address to join
==================

    >>> from mailman.email.message import Message
    >>> from mailman.queue.command import Results
    >>> mlist = create_list('alpha@example.com')

When no address argument is given, the message's From address will be used.
If that's missing though, then an error is returned.

    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print command.process(mlist, Message(), {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.no
    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    join: No valid address found to subscribe
    <BLANKLINE>

The 'subscribe' command is an alias.

    >>> subscribe = config.commands['subscribe']
    >>> print subscribe.name
    subscribe
    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print subscribe.process(mlist, Message(), {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.no
    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    subscribe: No valid address found to subscribe
    <BLANKLINE>


Joining the sender
==================

When the message has a From field, that address will be subscribed.

    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
    ...
    ... """)
    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print command.process(mlist, msg, {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.yes
    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Confirmation email sent to Anne Person <anne@example.com>
    <BLANKLINE>

Anne is not yet a member because she must confirm her subscription request
first.

    >>> from mailman.interfaces.usermanager import IUserManager
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> print getUtility(IUserManager).get_user('anne@example.com')
    None

Mailman has sent her the confirmation message.

    >>> virginq = config.switchboards['virgin']
    >>> qmsg, qdata = virginq.dequeue(virginq.files[0])
    >>> print qmsg.as_string()
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    ...
    Subject: confirm ...
    From: confirm-...@example.com
    To: anne@example.com
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Email Address Registration Confirmation
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hello, this is the GNU Mailman server at example.com.
    <BLANKLINE>
    We have received a registration request for the email address
    <BLANKLINE>
        anne@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    Before you can start using GNU Mailman at this site, you must first
    confirm that this is your email address.  You can do this by replying to
    this message, keeping the Subject header intact.  Or you can visit this
    web page
    <BLANKLINE>
        http://lists.example.com/confirm/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    If you do not wish to register this email address simply disregard this
    message.  If you think you are being maliciously subscribed to the list, or
    have any other questions, you may contact
    <BLANKLINE>
        postmaster@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>

Once Anne confirms her registration, she will be made a member of the mailing
list.

    >>> token = str(qmsg['subject']).split()[1].strip()
    >>> from mailman.interfaces.domain import IDomainManager
    >>> from mailman.interfaces.registrar import IRegistrar
    >>> registrar = IRegistrar(IDomainManager(config)['example.com'])
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True

    >>> user = getUtility(IUserManager).get_user('anne@example.com')
    >>> print user.real_name
    Anne Person
    >>> list(user.addresses)
    [<Address: Anne Person <anne@example.com> [verified] at ...>]

Anne is also now a member of the mailing list.

    >>> mlist.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    <Member: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
             on alpha@example.com as MemberRole.member>


Joining a second list
=====================

    >>> mlist_2 = create_list('baker@example.com')
    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
    ...
    ... """)
    >>> print command.process(mlist_2, msg, {}, (), Results())
    ContinueProcessing.yes

Anne of course, is still registered.

    >>> print getUtility(IUserManager).get_user('anne@example.com')
    <User "Anne Person" at ...>

But she is not a member of the mailing list.

    >>> print mlist_2.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    None

One Anne confirms this subscription, she becomes a member of the mailing list.

    >>> qmsg, qdata = virginq.dequeue(virginq.files[0])
    >>> token = str(qmsg['subject']).split()[1].strip()
    >>> registrar.confirm(token)
    True

    >>> print mlist_2.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    <Member: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
             on baker@example.com as MemberRole.member>


Leaving a mailing list
======================

The mail command 'leave' unsubscribes an email address from the mailing list.
'unsubscribe' is an alias for 'leave'.

    >>> command = config.commands['leave']
    >>> print command.name
    leave
    >>> print command.description
    Leave this mailing list.  You will be asked to confirm your request.

Anne is a member of the baker@example.com mailing list, when she decides to
leave it.  She sends a message to the -leave address for the list and is sent
a confirmation message for her request.

    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print command.process(mlist_2, msg, {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.yes
    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Anne Person <anne@example.com> left baker@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>

Anne is no longer a member of the mailing list.

    >>> print mlist_2.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    None

Anne does not need to leave a mailing list with the same email address she's
subscribe with.  Any of her registered, linked, and validated email addresses
will do.

    >>> anne = getUtility(IUserManager).get_user('anne@example.com')
    >>> address = anne.register('anne.person@example.org')

    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print mlist.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    <Member: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
             on alpha@example.com as MemberRole.member>

    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... To: alpha-leave@example.com
    ... From: anne.person@example.org
    ...
    ... """)

Since Anne's alternative address has not yet been verified, it can't be used
to unsubscribe Anne from the alpha mailing list.

    >>> print command.process(mlist, msg, {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.no

    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Invalid or unverified address: anne.person@example.org
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> print mlist.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    <Member: Anne Person <anne@example.com>
             on alpha@example.com as MemberRole.member>

Once Anne has verified her alternative address though, it can be used to
unsubscribe her from the list.

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> address.verified_on = datetime.now()

    >>> results = Results()
    >>> print command.process(mlist, msg, {}, (), results)
    ContinueProcessing.yes

    >>> print unicode(results)
    The results of your email command are provided below.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Anne Person <anne.person@example.org> left alpha@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> print mlist.members.get_member('anne@example.com')
    None
