Automatic responder
===================

In various situations, Mailman will send an automatic response to the author
of an email message.  For example, if someone sends a command to the -request
address, Mailman will send a response, but to cut down on third party spam,
the sender will only get a certain number of responses per day.

First, given a mailing list you need to adapt it to an IAutoResponseSet.

    >>> mlist = create_list('test@example.com')
    >>> from mailman.interfaces.autorespond import IAutoResponseSet
    >>> response_set = IAutoResponseSet(mlist)

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> verifyObject(IAutoResponseSet, response_set)
    True

You can't adapt other objects to an IAutoResponseSet.

    >>> IAutoResponseSet(object())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: ('Could not adapt', ...

There are various kinds of response types.  For example, Mailman will send an
automatic response when messages are held for approval, or when it receives an
email command.  You can find out how many responses for a particular address
have already been sent today.

    >>> address = config.db.user_manager.create_address(
    ...     u'aperson@example.com')
    >>> from mailman.interfaces.autorespond import Response
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.hold)
    0
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.command)
    0

Using the response set, we can record that a hold response is sent to the
address.

    >>> response_set.response_sent(address, Response.hold)
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.hold)
    1
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.command)
    0

We can also record that a command response was sent.

    >>> response_set.response_sent(address, Response.command)
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.hold)
    1
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.command)
    1

Let's send one more.

    >>> response_set.response_sent(address, Response.command)
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.hold)
    1
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.command)
    2

Now the day flips over and all the counts reset.

    >>> from mailman.utilities.datetime import factory
    >>> factory.fast_forward()

    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.hold)
    0
    >>> response_set.todays_count(address, Response.command)
    0
